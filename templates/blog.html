                <h5>Howdy, folks. I decided recently to start up a Dresden Files read and we're kicking things off today. So if you're gonna join, sound off, 
                    and maybe share what hooked you with the series. For new readers to the series, outside of popularity, what attracted you to try reading the series?
                    Also, a tip to newbies: Dresden is a giant dork. Don't ever forget that.
                    EDIT: I guess I should also ask, going forward, if we want to do two books a month 
                    (only one this month) or just one and if we want to do a start thread, a middle thread, and an end thread or just do a mid and end or what.

                Count me in.
                What drew me to Dresden? Combines two of my favorite genres: Fantasy and good ol detective noir.
                This is my first group read so looking forward to it!
                Edit: First time reading Dresden.

                    I started a couple of nights ago and I'm already having nostalgia pangs. Enough time has passed that I don't remember everything that happened in book 1, 
                    too, so that's nice.

                I'm going to be commenting based on my memories of re-reading, because I don't actually have time to re-read Dresden right now, but my main takeaway on re-reading Storm Front was amazement at just how many First Book-isms there are. There's a lot of stuff that Jim Butcher changed about Harry, about Murphy, and about how magic works.
